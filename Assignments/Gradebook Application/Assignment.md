Gradebook Assignment
====================

This assignment will be done in teams that are to be determined by the class in a voting manner.

Once teams have been chosen, each team is responsible for creating a viable storyboard that details the `gradebook` application that they are going to build.

This storyboard needs to cover:
* How the application will look (fairly accurate design and layout)
* The flow of the application (navigation, button clicks, dialogs, etc.,)
* Storyboards should accurately represent how the final product will operate


### Classroom
From now on each class will be graded on participation, attendance, commits, and progress.  If you do not attend class I can only assume, from your all's remarks, that it was too difficult outside of class to communicate...making
classroom attendance and participation even more critical to the success of the assignment.

### Out of class
Like all other college courses this class requires a fair amount of coursework outside of the classrom...however coursework is not entirely accurate, it is development...which is fun (and kind of what you are in CS for)!  I will expect that work is being done each week outside of class and that classroom time is mainly around facilitating the project and leveraging resources.


### Grading
A good majority of your points will come from your peers.  I would not take comfort in slacking off assuming friends will 'fluff' your grade...because they wont. I will hold everyone accountable for their academic honesty and I will compare it with github commits in case I fail to believe the honesty of the peer evaulations.
